# Bubble Sort

It is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are
in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the array is sorted.

Bubble sort is an in-place algorithm(doesnt consume extra space).
Bubble sort is stable(the order of equal elements is preserved).
